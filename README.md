I built an Animal Encyclopedia app with Vite that fetches data from an API and displays it in a clean, interactive interface. My modular code, async data loading, and simple HTML/CSS styling make it easy to learn about different animals. Since this was a first project of this scale for myself. I couldn't get the images to load with each card. A simple drawback to the project. Will update this draft.
